<h2>About Me</h2>
</div> 

<div id="posttag"><p id="top">To thy own self be true – Shakespeare, Act 1, Scene 3, Hamlet</p> </div>

<div id= "beliefs">
<p> I come from a collectivist culture where it takes a <span class="accent">village </span> to raise a child. 
    Now living in the diaspora, I have this constant battle with the individualistic society I know live in. 
    A    African family relationships are not as simplistic as European or Western family structures.
    I grew up in a village setting where it wasn’t just my parents who read my school report.
    My life and academic progress was everyone's business.</p>
    <p>In my <span class="accent"> culture </span> everything we do to further our lives, education or career is not done for oneself. 
        All is done for family and the <span class="accent">community</span>. 
        </p>
        <p class="quote">Without education, you are not going anywhere in this world. – Malcom X</p>
    <p>I value <span class="accent">wisdom </span>and knowledge gained through constant learning. Growth maters to me a lot. My deepest desire is to be wise. 
    And so I am always learning and growing.
    <span class="accent">Education </span>is an important part of life for me and within my family it comes before most things. 
    For me this means I am never the same person on every new year. 
    If I am the same person on every new year that means I have not learned anything, 
    nothing that has happened in the past year has moved me and I am bound to repeat the same mistakes and never grow.
     I am a natural <span class="accent">learner. </span> 
    I think being a web developer will suit me well, because it involves constant learning.
    Knowledge is power and to people of colour it is our freedom.

<p>My Myers Briggs type is INFJ, - <span class="accent"> Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Feeling (F), Judgment (J).</span>
    That’s Lisa Simpson, also called the counsellor. 
    <br>
    My Gallup top five strengths are; <span class="accent"> context, empathy, developer, achiever, and intellection. </span>

I know this about myself to be true. I see these as my strengths and try to use them well. I believe in understanding and embracing my strengths. I build upon them and use them for good. Its like everyone in the Marvel Universe has a superpower. It is their choice whether they use it for good or to destroy the world, or for greed.

                <li>I am a <span class="accent">confidant.</span> People do often tell me things they do not intend to share. Quite often they share their pain and shame with me.</li>
                <li>I prefer to <span class="accent"> listen.</span> I intentionally worked had to grow my listening skills.</li>
                <li>I take a lot of time out alone to reenergise. People don’t often understand or respect introversion which mean I am often misunderstood.</li>
                <li>I am very <span class="accent"> empathetic.</span> This is one of my traits that I sometimes see as a limitation. A bleeding heart. But I have leaned how to not become a bleeding heart. </li>
                <li>I trust my <span class="accent"> intuition </span>and so far it has not let me down. When I am wrong, it’s because I did not trust my intuition.</li>
                <li>I am a very <span class="accent"> organised </span>person. I plan everything. I even plan how I’m going to get out of bed in the morning. Every word I speak has been planned and well considered before it is spoken. </li>
