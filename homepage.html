      My name is Rosemary and this is my learning and discovery journal. 
        I am an eternal learner and seeker of enlightenment and wisdom. I love to read, and I am a curious child.
       This blog is a journey of enlightenment, a repository of the knowledge.

      <h2 class="sumhead">About Me</h2>
      <p class="sumpara"> Where I come from. My beliefs and values. Understanding and embracing my strengths.
          I have this insatiable need to be filled with knowledge and wisdom and to always know. And so I am always learning and growing.
