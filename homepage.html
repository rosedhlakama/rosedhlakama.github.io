    <p id="Welcome">Welcome to my learning and discovery journal. 
        I am an eternal learner and seeker of enlightenment and wisdom. I love to read, and I read everything and anything that captures my interest. I am a curious child.
         On my blog I will be sharing the pieces of knowledge and wisdom that I pick up day by day.
       This is journey of enlightenment, a repository of the knowledge I shall gain. 
        Iâ€™m going to start by learning more about the history of my people. It's important to me to keep connected with my heritage while living and surviving the diaspora.
