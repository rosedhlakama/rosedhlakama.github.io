<h1> About Me</h1>
</div> 

<p class="tag">To thy own self be true – Shakespeare, Act 1, Scene 3, Hamlet</p>
<p>I value wisdom and knowledge gained through constant learning. Education is an important part of life for me and within my family it comes before most things. For me this means I am never the same person on every new year. If I am the same person on every new year that means I have not learned anything, nothing that has happened in the past year has moved me and I am bound to repeat the same mistakes and never grow. Growth maters to me a lot. My deepest desire is to be wise. I have this insatiable need to be filled with knowledge and wisdom and to always know. And so I am always learning and growing. 
    I love to read and learn. I am a natural learner. That’s why I think being a web developer will suit me well, because it involves constant learning. I read everything from The Economist to Harry Potter. Knowledge is power and to people of colour it is our freedom.

<p class="quote">Without education, you are not going anywhere in this world. – Malcom X</p>
<p>I come from a collectivist culture where it takes a village to raise a child. Now living in the diaspora, I have this constant battle with the individualistic society I know live in. As a child, I was always surrounded by people, neighbours and members of my extended family. African family relationships are not as simplistic as European or Western family structures. In my culture there is no such thing as cousins. If you share grandparents, you are brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>I remember one incident when I was about seven years old. I was walking home from school dragging my school bag behind me. I did not come from a land of plenty and so my school bag would have cost my mother a lot of money and I was mistreating it. It was not my intention to be careless, but I was tired. As I turned into my street one of my neighbours, a young lady of high school age stopped me. With her gentle tone, she told me I needed to be to take better care of my belongings and schoolbooks. She then picked my bag up, dusted it off and showed me how to carry it easier. I will never forget that. I remember this every time I put on a backpack. In New Zealand it is an absolute faux-par to do what she did. </p>
<p>I grew up in a village setting where everyone was responsible for teaching the children. At the end of the school year it wasn’t just my parents who read my school report, my entire community wanted to know if I was doing well in school. </p>
<p>Before you seriously misunderstand me, when I say I grew up in a village, I don’t mean some place like what you are shown on the Save the Children commercials. I grew up in a suburban area. </p>
<p>In my culture everything we do to further our lives, education or career is not done for oneself. All is done for family and the village. Family and community are very important to me and form a crucial part of my identity. I grew up within a village and I continue to grow my village. </p>
<p>I value charity and compassion as part of how I simply live my life. This value is heavily influenced by my religion and village existence. It means practising kindness and generosity towards those who need some compassion. It’s about being human, forgiving and not walking away form those who are suffering.</p>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<p>My Myers Briggs type is INFJ, - Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Feeling (F), Judgment (J).
    That’s Lisa Simpson, also called the counsellor. 
    <br>
    My Gallup top five strengths are; context, empathy, developer, achiever, and intellection
<br>
I know this about myself to be true. I see these as my strengths and try to use them well. I believe in understanding and embracing my strengths. I build upon them and use them for good. Its like everyone in the Marvel Universe has a superpower. It is their choice whether they use it for good or to destroy the world, or for greed. 
<br>
So my strengths described as how I see them and use them.

            <td>INFJ is often described as the rarest MBTI type with 1% - 1.5% of the world’s population.
                I am a confidant. People do often tell me things they do not intend to share. Quite often they share their pain and shame with me.
                I am a good listener. I intentionally worked had to grow my listening skills.<br>
                I take a lot of time out alone to reenergise. People don’t often understand or respect introversion which mean I am often misunderstood.<br>
                I am very empathetic. This is one of my traits that I sometimes see as a limitation. A bleeding heart. But I have leaned how to not become a bleeding heart. Understanding people in this way has helped my bridge gaps and build great relationships. 
                I trust my intuition and so far it has not let me down. When I am wrong, it’s because I did not trust my intuition.<br>
                I am a very organised person. I plan everything. I even pan how I’m going to get out of bed in the morning. Every word I speak has been planned and well considered before it is spoken
