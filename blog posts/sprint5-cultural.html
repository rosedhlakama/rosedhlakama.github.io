            <h3 class="P8-Q1 QUE">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>My ego (as described by Eckhart Tolle in the Power of Now) is very loud and I will continue to work on silencing it and being present. </p>
            <h3 class="P8-Q2 QUE">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>How well I engaged with it and how much of it there is. I’m not going to share my personal reflection from the previous exercise. Have to keep something to myself.</p>

        <div class = "p8Para2">
            <h3 class="P8-Q3 QUE">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>Sharing. I am a private person and I didn’t enjoy publishing my thoughts and reflections.</p>
            <h3 class="P8-Q4 QUE">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>Its not just the ability to code that matters. Its also the ability to relate to fellow humans that you are either working with or working for. Having spent some time in the public sector I realised how important empathy and compassion are when you are working with other people. We spend a lot of our time at work, it matters that we can relate to the people around us.</p>

        <div class = "p8Para3">
            <h3 class="P8-Q5 QUE">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>
                There were moments during foundations when I felt I didn’t want to do any of the core skills exercises. I wanted to just focus on learning developer skills. I am trying to become a web developer after all. I have put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed at web development and make that my lifestyle. That is what matters the most to me. As someone who has very little prior experience in web developing, I know I am way behind and need to work harder than everyone else. 
                However I trust the process. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain from the core skills. I have grown, significantly in the past 5 weeks and not only because of my basic Javascript skills.
