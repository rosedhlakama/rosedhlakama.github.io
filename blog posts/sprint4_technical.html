        <br>
        <p>
            Our fist web page development challenge when we had to post the blogs for Sprint 2.
            I could see my local webpage clearly, but when I committed to github and checked my web pages were not live. 
            It kept coming up with an error page. But I could still open the local html file and view my webpage. 
            <br>
            I panicked because I had done a lot of work and learning. 
            It seemed I might have lost it.
            I tried a few things to fix the problem. I googled the problem and couldn’t find a solution. 
            I tried books, reread the instructions for pushing to github. Still nothing.
            When I felt I had reached the end of my rope, I sent a message to my facilitator explaining the issues and included screenshots. 
            <br>
            Turns out I had renamed my index.html file to home page. 
            When a web browser is looking through a folder for what files to read, it looks for  an index.html by default as the original page to show. 
            I needed to save my homepage as 'index.html', otherwise it won't know where to look.
            <br>
            So simple.
            Looking back, I’m sure that was in the instructions but because I was now in panic mode, I missed it and made a silly mistake.
