            <h3 class="accent">That time I got blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our fist web page development challenge when we had to post the blogs for Sprint 2.
                I could see my local webpage clearly, but when I committed to github and checked my web pages were not live. 
                It kept coming up with an error page. But I could still open the local html file and view my webpage. 
                <br>
                I panicked because I had done a lot of work and learning. 
                It seemed I might have lost it.
                I tried a few things to fix the problem. I googled the problem and couldn’t find a solution. 
                I tried books, reread the instructions for pushing to github. Still nothing.
                When I felt I had reached the end of my rope, I sent a message to my facilitator explaining the issues and included screenshots. 
                <br>
                Turns out I had renamed my index.html file to home page. 
                When a web browser is looking through a folder for what files to read, it looks for  an index.html by default as the original page to show. 
                I needed to save my homepage as 'index.html', otherwise it won't know where to look.
                <br>
                So simple.
                Looking back, I’m sure that was in the instructions but because I was now in panic mode, I missed it and made a silly mistake.

            <h3 class="accent">Three techniques I am confident will aid my problem solving are:</h3>
            <h5 class="QUE">Pseudocode</h5>
            <p>
                Writing in plain English what my code is intending do. 
                I learned from my last job writing minutes that time spent planning is more valuable than time spent writing minutes. 
                I can see how this will be handy when applied to code writing. 
                Pseudocode will help me plan and help me define my code before I write it.

        <!-- item 5 of container -->
        <div class="p7paras p7para3">
            <h5 class="QUE">Rubber ducky method</h5>
            <p>
                This is me. The rubber ducky method is fantastic for all problems. 
                I do this with my mum, but she doesn’t understand that I’m not looking for her to solve my problems. 
                I have nothing against ducks but I love rhinos more so I might use a rubber rhino instead.

        <!-- item 6 of container -->
        <div class="p7paras p7para4">
            <h5 class="QUE">Asking for help</h5>
            <p>
                I’m an only child, fiercely independent so this does not come naturally to me. 
                I don’t always ask for help because I don’t want to appear stupid. 
                As I got older and wiser I stopped caring too much about how I appear if I ask questions. 
                My ancestors used to say ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.’
                I will be asking everyone, my peers, and uncle google.
