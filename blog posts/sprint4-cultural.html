            Research on brain plasticity has shown how connectivity between neurons can change with experience. 
            With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. 
            This means that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.
            And when you believe your brain can grow, you behave differently.
            Understanding neuroplasticity develops a growth mindset. If you believe you can get smarter, that effort makes you stronger and when learning is your goal you will spend more time and work harder. 
            This all leads to higher achievement.

                It’s like exercise. The more squats I do regularly and consistently the stronger my gluts get.
                The brain is a muscle and the more practice I put in, the stronger the neuro-connections get. 
                Each new activity creates a neuro-connection in my brain and repetition of that activity makes that connection stronger and insulates it.
                So the saying; you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, is absolutely false.

                Practice, Practice, Practice – I’m going to need more discipline to do this.
                Put the information I learn into context so I can relate to it.
