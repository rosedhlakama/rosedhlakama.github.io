        <p class="responses P6-R1">
            Research on brain plasticity has shown how connectivity between neurons can change with experience. 
            With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. 
            This means that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.
            And when you believe your brain can grow, you behave differently.
            Understanding neuroplasticity develops a growth mindset. If you believe you can get smarter, that effort makes you stronger and when learning is your goal you will spend more time and work harder. 
            This all leads to higher achievement.

        <p class="responses P6-R2">
                It’s like exercise. The more squats I do regularly and consistently the stronger my gluts get.
                The brain is a muscle and the more practice I put in, the stronger the neuro-connections get. 
                Each new activity creates a neuro-connection in my brain and repetition of that activity makes that connection stronger and insulates it.
                So the saying; you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, is absolutely false.

                Practice, Practice, Practice – I’m going to need more discipline to do this,
                as well as, put the information I learn into context so I can relate to it.

        <!-- item 12 of container -->
        <p class="responses P6-R5">
                The realisation that I have a somewhat fixed mindset. I took the test.<br>
                Even though I do take creative risks I don’t finish difficult tasks. 
                I just cancel myself out believing that I’m not smart enough to do something. <br>
                Learning JavaScript made me feel this way too. The fear of failure.

                I am going to Learn the skill of learning.
                Developing a growth mindset is now part of my self-growth objectives.
                Practice affirmations by reminding myself that I am creating new neuro-connections. Which means my brain is getting bigger and isn't that wonderful.

                I understand the importance of treating my fixed mindset and be like the little girl in the video.
                I need to conquer my fear of failing.
