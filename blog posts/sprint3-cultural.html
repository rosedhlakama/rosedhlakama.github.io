        The standing definition of Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognise, differentiate and manage our emotions and the emotions of others around us.
        In 1990 American Professors, Peter Salovey and John Mayer, identified Emotional Intelligence as a type of self-awareness with greater influence on human behaviour and life outcomes than just good old brain power and IQ. 
        Journalist David Goleman expanded the concept in 1995 and noted three levels of Emotional Intelligence:
        <dl id="listEQlevels">
          <dt>Cognitive</dt>
          <dd>Understanding other’s motivations and emotions so well that a respectful, trusting </dd>
          <dt>Emotional</dt>
          <dd>Recognising the emotions of others</dd>
          <dt>Empathetic Concern</dt>
          <dd>Feeling what others feel, the basis of compassion</dd>          
        </dl>
        Unlike IQ (Intelligence Quotient), Emotional Intelligence is learned and learnable.
        The Word Economic Forum’s Future Jobs report states that emotional intelligence will be among the Top 10 most desirable job skills in 2020.
        Emotional Intelligence has its foundations in empathy, compassion and mindfulness.
        Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others by putting yourself in their situation. It is one of the most important attributes for effective leadership.
        Dr Brené Brown, shares an interesting illustration into empathy and how to create genuine empathetic connections.

        Compassion is a social emotion that enables people to live and thrive in communities. Compassion literally means to suffer together. It is what drives us to act when confronted with another’s suffering. 
        According to The Mindful education group (https://mindfulnesseducation.nz/what-is-mindfulness/), mindfulness is the art of giving your full, open-hearted attention to what is immediately occurring, physically and mentally, within and around you. It’s about being present and in the moment with kindness and curiosity.
        This short animation by Happify illustrats how mindfulness is a superpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/w6T02g5hnT4">Watch animtation video</a>
        Mindfulness is the antidote that helps us stay in the flow or in alignment with yourself. When you are in alignment with yourself you are completely absolved in what you are doing, you are fully present. When we are not fully present, we lark compassion.
        People who are emotionally intelligent have high self-awareness, manage their emotions effectively, are self-motivated, show empathy to others and create strong connections, relationships.
        Emotionally intelligent individuals are also good active listeners and are therefore able to connect with people effectively.  The art of being a good listener involves; being fully present, empathy. Active listening and curiosity.
        Good listeners see every conversation as a lesson and therefore are present on conversations, actively listening, not preparing a response.
        Great listeners step out of themselves ad try to understand why another person may be thinking or feeling a certain way. They let the speaker know that they are paying attention and understand.
        Curious people take all conversations as learning opportunities, and when we are curious about something, we tend to listen more closely. Everyone has a desire to be heard.
        Practice emotional hygiene through self-reflection, marshalling your positive emotions, managing the negative and shoeing compassion to others.
