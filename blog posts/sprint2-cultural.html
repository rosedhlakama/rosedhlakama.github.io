    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Long-term goals and career pathway</h3>
    <p>
        I am intending to work with my new coding skills to continue to pursue my beliefs and interest. 
        My new skills will provide me with a more dynamic way of expressing my creativity.
        And of course, I would like to change the world.
        My ideal destination would include the rights of women, children and migrants as well as conservation.     
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Biggest Strengths and limitations at Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
        My level of prior experience.<br>
        I still have a lot to learn as compared to my cohort colleagues from what I can see on Slack. 
        I don’t want to be left behind because I need more time to grasp the concepts.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Biggest non-Technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
        Getting through it with strength and focus.<br>
        I am worried about whether I have it in me to keep up with the pace and achieve my learning goals. 
        Foundations has shown me that I might have been wrong to believe I personally could do my best within a five-week timeframe. 
        I expect bootcamp to be much harder therefore worsening my anxiety.        
    </p>
    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Non-technical human skills I would like to develope while at EDA</h3>
    <p>
        Better self-awareness and relationship building skills.       
    </p>
    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Expectaions from the Bootcamp team</h3>
    <p>
       Help, support, patience and understanding in every way.  
       I am hoping for an environment that facilitates growth 
    </p>
    <h3 class="h3 hh3">Expectaions of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
            I expect my-self to work very hard, do my absolute best, 
            exceed my own expectation and 
            get a good job where I can continue learning and improving my technical skills.

        I am expecting a lot of challenges ahead. I’m not sure what to expect during bootcamp. But I do know I will not be alone.
        I am fully committed to successfully completing this course, making new friends and working with others to get there.
        Being an active participating member of the dev and wider community will be crucial to the learning process.
        Knowing myself- the only way I can do this is by being open and showing up.
        I will seek help and offer help.
        I will seek help when I need it, which is usually when I hit a wall.
        This will be from my fellow students, the dev teaching staff and uncle google.
        I expect the facilitators and teaching staff will provide constant constructive feedback, timely response to queries, respect and compassion.
